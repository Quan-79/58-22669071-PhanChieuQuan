        Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing
        success!
      </v>
      After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion,
      it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful
      performances. I've started putting up a <u>slide show</u> of the
      production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If
      you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me. Once
      again:
      <v>BRAVO!!!</v>
